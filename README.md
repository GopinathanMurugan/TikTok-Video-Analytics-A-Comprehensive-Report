## Data Source
- **Dataset Composition:**
  - Contains 19,382 records of TikTok videos.
  - Features video metrics, metadata, and author-related information.
- **Key Data Columns:**
  - Metrics: Views, likes, shares, downloads, and comments.
  - Metadata: Video duration, transcription text, and unique IDs.
  - Author Information: Verification status and ban status.
  - Claim Status: Denotes whether a video is under a claim.
- **Collection Method:**
  - Extracted from a comprehensive repository of TikTok user-generated content.

## Data Cleaning
Steps undertaken to ensure high-quality data:
1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Identified missing entries in video metrics and metadata columns.
   - Imputed numerical missing values using mean or median imputation.
   - Removed rows with excessive missing information when imputation was not feasible.

2. **Outlier Management:**
   - Detected outliers in metrics like views, likes, and shares using IQR and Z-scores.
   - Capped or transformed extreme values to minimize their influence.

3. **Data Type Standardization:**
   - Ensured consistency in numerical data types (e.g., converting float to integers for counts).
   - Standardized date formats for potential temporal analyses.
4. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned transcription text by removing special characters, punctuations, and emojis.
   - Applied stemming and lemmatization to normalize textual content.
5. **Categorical Encoding:**
   - Transformed non-numerical features such as verification and ban status into binary variables.
   - Used one-hot encoding for categorical variables with multiple levels.
6. **Duplicated Records:**
   - Identified and removed duplicate video records to ensure data integrity.
7. **Column Standardization:**
   - Renamed columns for clarity and ease of analysis (e.g., `video_duration_sec` instead of `duration`).
8. **Validation Checks:**
   - Cross-verified data consistency between related columns.
   - Ensured no inconsistencies in key identifiers like video IDs.
9. **Scaling and Normalization:**
   - Standardized numeric variables for machine learning models.
10. **Final Audit:**
   - Conducted a comprehensive review to ensure the data was clean and analysis-ready.

## Data Analysis
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Computed descriptive statistics for all metrics to understand central tendencies and variability.
   - Created distribution plots to analyze data spread and identify skewness in metrics.
   - Developed heatmaps to visualize correlations among metrics such as views, likes, shares, and comments.

   - Explored the impact of verification status and ban status on engagement metrics using boxplots.
2. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Examined temporal patterns in video engagement by grouping data by posting times and dates.
   - Analyzed seasonal trends to determine optimal posting schedules.

3. **Engagement Factor Analysis:**
   - Used pairwise scatterplots to examine relationships between views, likes, and shares.
     ![Scatter Plot: Likes vs Shares](likes_vs_shares.png)
   - Performed clustering to segment videos based on engagement patterns.
4. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Conducted t-tests to evaluate differences in engagement between verified and non-verified accounts.
   - Used ANOVA to analyze the influence of video duration on user interaction metrics.
5. **Text Analysis:**
   - Performed word frequency analysis on transcription text to identify popular topics and phrases.
     ![Word Cloud](word_cloud.png)
   - Applied sentiment analysis to determine the tone of content and its impact on performance.
6. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Developed machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict engagement metrics.
   - Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated models using cross-validation.
7. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
   - Identified critical KPIs, such as average engagement rate and virality score.
   - Assessed KPIs across different video categories.
8. **Visualizations:**
   - Designed comprehensive dashboards to present findings interactively.
9. **Feature Importance Analysis:**
   - Identified the most influential factors driving video engagement using feature importance metrics.
10. **Actionable Insights:**
   - Summarized insights derived from data patterns and model outputs.
